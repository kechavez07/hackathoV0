🧑‍💻 Use cases & track focus
We’re looking for projects that tackle real problems and have long-term potential. Blockchain can play a supporting role storing information, adding transparency, or enabling new interactions, but it doesn’t need to be the star of the show.

Examples:

Apps that make everyday tasks easier while keeping data secure
Tools for communities or teams that benefit from transparent records
Platforms with real-world impact, where blockchain quietly adds value
🛠️ Tech requirements
Your solution must be built/compatible with the Lisk Ecosystem
